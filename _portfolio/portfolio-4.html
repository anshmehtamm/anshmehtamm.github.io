This project was developed as part of the course CSE3201 Natural Language Processing at LNMIIT.
<br><br> The project is a simple NLP project that extracts relations between characters in a novel. The project uses the spaCY library to extract Named Entities from the text, 
and then uses a simple rule-based system to extract relations between the characters.
<br>
The project was developed in Python, and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/anshmehtamm/nlp-novel">Github</a>
