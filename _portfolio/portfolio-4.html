This project was developed as part of the course CSE3201 Natural Language Processing at LNMIIT. The project is a simple NLP project that extracts relations between characters in a novel. The project uses the spaCY library to extract Named Entities from the text, 
and then uses a simple rule-based system to extract relations between the characters.

The project was developed in Python, and the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/anshmehtamm/nlp-novel)
