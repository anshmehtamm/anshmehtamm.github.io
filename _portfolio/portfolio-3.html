This project is an implementation of a Tetris agent that plays the game using Reinforcement Learning.
The agent uses a Deep Q Network to learn the optimal policy for playing the game. 
The agent was trained using the OpenAI Gym environment for Tetris. 
<br>
The training code is available on <a href="https://github.com/anshmehtamm/tetris-ai">Github</a>


Checkout a little demo below of the agent playing the game.
