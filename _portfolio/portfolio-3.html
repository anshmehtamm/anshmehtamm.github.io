This project is an implementation of a Tetris agent that plays the game using Reinforcement Learning.<br>
The agent uses a Deep Q Network to learn the optimal policy for playing the game and was trained using the OpenAI Gym environment for Tetris, training code is available on <a href="https://github.com/anshmehtamm/tetris-ai">Github</a>

Checkout a little demo below of the agent playing the game.
