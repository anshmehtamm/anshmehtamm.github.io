This project was developed during the DeveloperWeek 2024 Hackathon.  <br>
The project is iOS application that summarizes news articles using GPT-3.5. 
The application uses the OpenAI API to generate summaries of news articles, and uses google news API to fetch the latest articles.
 <br><br>Currently I have stopped the backend server, so the application is not functional.  <br>
 I plan to re-deploy the server in the future, and publish the application on the App Store.
