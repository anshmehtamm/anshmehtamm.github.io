This project is an implementation of a Tetris agent that plays the game using Reinforcement Learning.
The agent uses a Deep Q Network to learn the optimal policy for playing the game. 
The agent was trained using the OpenAI Gym environment for Tetris. 
The training code is available on [Github](https://github.com/anshmehtamm/tetris-ai).

Checkout a little demo below of the agent playing the game.
